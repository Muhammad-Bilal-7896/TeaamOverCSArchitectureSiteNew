Interior trends will be more naturalistic because in-house planting like roof gardening, green patios were being likings. Tree Houses have gained a lot of heed during the past few years while now trees are becoming a part of a house. In this global warming situation where everyone is worried about it, is a good sign.",

There is a philosophy behind every scene and interior design has a philosophy of its own. The interior philosophy dissolute in itself social customs, traditions of every culture, the reason is that cultural philosophy does not remain virgin; a collaboration of different cultures gives birth to impurities. There are some hard and stiff cultural values that are continuing for hundreds of years and are the same as they were before. It is also true that man always remains in search of newer than new and his conscience cannot be comforted until its craving will not be fulfilled and creative minds do not let this hunger finished, and by old or new means try to tease or sometimes try to ease this urgency. In the search for more and more, many trends are being followed but how many? Let’s try to find the answer to this question. < p > < br /> < p class= \"text-dark\" > Most of us know about the energies, the things have; negative or positive, more negative or more positive with different levels of variations and tendencies. Color Palettes are chosen differently according to the place, its function and position. The colors that will be used in homes will be different, in offices they will be different and in worship places they will be different, why? Because colors absorb and reflect the energies with a specific saturation. Shades affect our personality, feelings, consciousness and behavior. That’s why people are very curious regarding color selection. In 2022, dark & bold palettes will be going on, the vibrant schemes will be used because since the last year the dark coding has been increased. < p > ",
