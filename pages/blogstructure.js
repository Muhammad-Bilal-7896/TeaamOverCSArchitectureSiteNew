        "BlogDescription": "<p class= \"text-dark\" > Most Hamptons houses are designed to fulfill client dreams of luxury and lifestyle, in a process that relies heavily on photos. But architecture is also an art, independent of photography, with the capacity to provoke thought. And you can’t see architectural thought in photos, really. You need to look at floor plans. </p> <p class= \"text-dark\"> When I say this, my clients insist that they “can’t read plans.” This is no surprise, since we live in a world where even shelter magazines no longer print floor plans on their glossy pages. But plans do matter, because that’s where buildings are conceptualized – the napkin sketch. As the renaissance architect, Leon Battista Alberti, famously proclaimed: architects make drawings! </p> <p class= \"text-dark\"> I assure my clients that plans are not difficult to read. They are just diagrams, little different from a subway map or the gameboard for Clue. But since my profession has been complicit in creating this disability, I also offer them this insight: architecture is not just a visual art, it is a narrative art as well. You can employ the very skills you acquired in school for analyzing books and movies to discover the art in our designs. If you know poetry, all the better. </p> <p class= \"text-dark\"> Try this approach with the plans on this page. First, think of rooms as characters, then find the front door and start “walking” through the plans looking for clues about each space. We’ve purposely removed the easy clues, like furniture and cabinetry, so you will have to look closely. You’ll quickly see how easy this becomes. </p> <p class= \"text-dark\"> Next, recognize that each path you take through a plan is like a plot, or subplot, in the lives of those who might live there. After all, every house will have lots of “readers.” Respect the fact that in a great story, even minor characters are essential. The passage from garage to kitchen, for instance, should be designed with as much care as the path from front door to living room. Houses are nothing if not evolving family epics. </p> <p class= \"text-dark\"> I could write at length about narratives, but the plans on this page have another quality worth mentioning. They have an abstract and graphic beauty all their own. Like Moroccan tile patterns, great diagrams have the ability to trap us in their worlds. We might see symmetries at first, and think we understand their order. Then we discover asymmetrical moments that contradict, and metaphors emerge. Order vs. Chaos. Rules vs. License. Code vs. Mutation. </p> <p class= \"text-dark\"> In his first, and most provocative, book the noted architect Robert Venturi identified complexity and contradiction as the key to architectural thought – our poetics. Opinions will vary, but there can be no doubt that when viewed in this way, architecture has the capacity to produce pleasures well beyond the pleasures we associate with the images of luxury captured by photographs. </p> ",

There is a philosophy behind every scene and interior design has a philosophy of its own. The interior philosophy dissolute in itself social customs, traditions of every culture, the reason is that cultural philosophy does not remain virgin; a collaboration of different cultures gives birth to impurities. There are some hard and stiff cultural values that are continuing for hundreds of years and are the same as they were before. It is also true that man always remains in search of newer than new and his conscience cannot be comforted until its craving will not be fulfilled and creative minds do not let this hunger finished, and by old or new means try to tease or sometimes try to ease this urgency. In the search for more and more, many trends are being followed but how many? Let’s try to find the answer to this question. < p > < br /> < p class= \"text-dark\" > Most of us know about the energies, the things have; negative or positive, more negative or more positive with different levels of variations and tendencies. Color Palettes are chosen differently according to the place, its function and position. The colors that will be used in homes will be different, in offices they will be different and in worship places they will be different, why? Because colors absorb and reflect the energies with a specific saturation. Shades affect our personality, feelings, consciousness and behavior. That’s why people are very curious regarding color selection. In 2022, dark & bold palettes will be going on, the vibrant schemes will be used because since the last year the dark coding has been increased. < p > ",
